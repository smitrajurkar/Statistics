Q1. What is Statistics?
Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting,
and presenting data.

Q2. Types of Statistics with Example
1. Descriptive Statistics: Summarizes data using mean, median, charts.
Example: Calculating average marks of a class.
2. Inferential Statistics: Makes predictions using samples.
Example: Predicting election results using surveys.

Q3. Types of Data
1. Qualitative Data: Non-numerical (e.g., colors).
2. Quantitative Data: Numerical (e.g., height).
   
Q4. Categorization of Data
(i) Grading in exam: Qualitative (Ordinal)
(ii) Colour of mangoes: Qualitative (Nominal)
(iii) Height data: Quantitative (Continuous)
(iv) Number of mangoes exported: Quantitative (Discrete)

Q5. Levels of Measurement
Nominal: Gender
Ordinal: Rank
Interval: Temperature (°C)
Ratio: Weight

Q6. Importance of Levels of Measurement
It helps choose correct statistical methods. Example: Mean cannot be calculated for nominal data.

Q7. Nominal vs Ordinal Data
Nominal has no order; Ordinal has ranking.

Q8. Plot for Range
Box plot.

Q9. Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics
Descriptive: Summarizes data (mean).
Inferential: Draws conclusions (hypothesis testing).

Q10. Measures of Central Tendency & Variability
Central Tendency: Mean, Median, Mode
Variability: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation

Q1. What are the three measures of central tendency?
The three measures of central tendency are:
1.Mean
2.Median
3.Mode

Q2. What is the difference between the mean, median, and mode? How are they used to measure the
central tendency of a dataset?
 Measure      Definition                  Use                                     
 Mean        Average of all values        Best when data has no extreme values    
 Median      Middle value after sorting   Best when data has outliers             
 Mode        Most frequent value          Useful for categorical or repeated data 

Q3. Measure the three measures of central tendency for the given height data:
[178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5]
1.Mean = 177.02
2.Median = 177
3.Mode = 177 and 178

Q4. Find the standard deviation for the given data:
[178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5]
1.Sample Standard Deviation = 1.85
2.Population Standard Deviation = 1.79

Q5. How are measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation used to describe
the spread of a dataset? Provide an example.
1.Range: Difference between maximum and minimum values
2.Variance: Average of squared deviations
3.Standard Deviation: Square root of variance
Example:
If student heights vary widely, dispersion will be high.

Q6. What is a Venn diagram?
A Venn diagram is a graphical representation used to show relationships between sets using overlapping circles.

Q7. For the two given sets A = (2,3,4,5,6,7) & B = (0,2,6,8,10). Find:
(i) A B    : {2, 6}
(ii) A ⋃ B : {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10}

Q8. What do you understand about skewness in data?
1.Right skewed → tail on right
2.Left skewed → tail on left
3.Symmetric → no skew

Q9. If a data is right skewed then what will be the position of median with respect to mean?
Mean > Median

Q10. Explain the difference between covariance and correlation. How are these measures used in
statistical analysis?
             Covariance       Correlation          

 Measures   Direction         Strength & direction 
 Range      No fixed range    -1 to +1             
 Units      Affected           Unit-free            

Q11. What is the formula for calculating the sample mean? Provide an example calculation for a
dataset.
xˉ=n∑xi​​
Example:
For data [2, 4, 6]: xˉ= 12/3 ​= 4
	​
Q12. For a normal distribution data what is the relationship between its measure of central tendency?
Mean = Median = Mode

Q13. How is covariance different from correlation?
1.Covariance shows direction only
2.Correlation shows direction and strength
3.Correlation is standardized

Q14. How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example.
 Measure                Effect of Outliers 

 Mean                   Highly affected    
 Median                 Less affected      
 Standard Deviation     Increases     
Example:
Data: [10, 12, 11, 13, 100]
Mean increases sharply due to 100
Median remains stable
